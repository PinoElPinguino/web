I worked in a team of four on a database project  for the *Databases 1* class in college. The goal of the project was to create a basic working model of a country's healthcare system and associated documentation to test our knowledge in **MySQL**. I was responsible for devising and creating 80% of the queries and helped edit the documentation.
